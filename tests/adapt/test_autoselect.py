"""Tests for global-optimal conversion and automatic target-model selection.

Anchored on a real-world failure: OpenCV-fisheye (Kannala-Brandt) lenses whose
radial curve inflects (large +k1 with strong negative higher terms) cannot be
held by the Double Sphere / UCM family at *any* parameters. ``convert_best`` must
escalate model capacity until the reprojection RMS clears the tolerance.
