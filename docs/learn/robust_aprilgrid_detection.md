# Deep-dive — detecting every AprilGrid tag, even at the fisheye periphery

A calibration is only as good as the corners you feed it — and on a fisheye, the corners that
matter most are the hardest to detect. The wide-angle tags near the image edge are exactly the
ones that pin down the distortion, and a naïve detector drops them. This page is the story of
finding that out on real data and fixing it, with a number at every step. The fix lives in
[`ds_msp/calib/detect.py`](../../ds_msp/calib/detect.py).

## 1. The symptom: most of the board goes undetected

Point the detector at TUM-VI's calib footage and count tags per frame (the board has 36):

```python
import glob
from aprilgrid import Detector
from ds_msp.calib.detect import _load_gray_u8

paths = sorted(glob.glob("datasets/tumvi/dataset-calib-cam1_512_16/mav0/cam0/data/*.png"))
det = Detector("t36h11")
for i in (158, 316, 276):                      # frames where the board is off-centre
    g = _load_gray_u8(paths[i])
    print(f"frame {i}: {len(det.detect(g))}/36 tags")
# frame 158: 22/36   frame 316: 4/36   frame 276: 0/36
```

Frame 316 is the damning one: the **entire board is in the image — fully visible, well-lit, no
blur — sitting in the top-right corner**, and the detector finds **4 of 36 tags**. This is not
a data problem. You can see the tags; the detector can't.

## 2. Why it happens — and why it's *not* curved edges

The intuitive guess is "fisheye bends the tag edges, so the square-quad detector fails." That's
real but secondary. The dominant cause is **size**: a fisheye *compresses* the periphery, so a
peripheral tag is only a handful of pixels across, and the detector's minimum-cluster-size gate
throws it out before it ever tries to decode. The proof is that simply **upscaling the image
recovers the tags** — same pixels, same edges, just bigger:

```python
import cv2
from ds_msp.calib.detect import _detect_union          # detect at several scales, union by id
g = _load_gray_u8(paths[316])
print("native     :", len(_detect_union(det, g, (1,))), "/36")        # 4
print("multi-scale:", len(_detect_union(det, g, (1, 2, 3))), "/36")   # 26
```

4 → 26 from upscaling alone. Across a 12-frame spread the recall goes from **155/432 (36 %) to
408/432 (94 %)**.

## 3. What the "robust" libraries actually do (myth vs. reality)

It's tempting to assume Kalibr and Basalt have a distortion-aware detector. They don't:

- **Kalibr** (`GridCalibrationTargetAprilgrid`) runs a per-tag C++ detector on the raw image and
  keeps only what it finds — **no recovery of missed tags**. It wins by a mature backend at full
  resolution and the fact that each tag is small enough to be *locally* near-planar.
- **Basalt** wraps AprilTag-3 (C) and aggregates **many frames** — a tag missed in one frame is
  caught in another.
- The libraries that genuinely recover hard tags are **ChArUco** (`refineDetectedMarkers` +
  corner interpolation from the board model) and **TartanCalib** (reproject expected corners via
  a partial model and re-detect locally). Both are *board-guided recovery*.

So the answer isn't a magic detector — it's **feed the detector better, and use the board to
recover what's still missing.** Two techniques, below.

## 4. Fix #1 — multi-scale detection (the big, cheap win)

Detect on up-scaled copies of the image and union the results by tag id. The default
`scales=(1, 2, 3)` is what took recall from 36 % to 94 % above:

```python
from ds_msp.calib import detect_aprilgrid
dets = detect_aprilgrid(paths, scales=(1, 2, 3))     # default; pass (1,) for the old behaviour
```

But — and this is the part worth internalizing — **adding corners the wrong way makes the
calibration *worse*, not better.** Two subtleties decide whether multi-scale helps or hurts.

### Subtlety A: refine at the *detection* scale, not at native resolution

`cv2.cornerSubPix` needs a search window. A window that suits a big central tag (say 5 px) spans
**several corners** of a tiny peripheral tag and drags it onto the wrong one. If you detect at 3×
but then refine at native resolution, you corrupt exactly the corners you just gained:

| | median reproj | focal error |
|---|---|---|
| single-scale | 0.126 px | 0.84 % |
| multi-scale, refine at **native** res | **0.87 px** ❌ | 1.7 % |
| multi-scale, refine at **detection** scale | **0.105 px** ✅ | 0.7 % |

The fix is to refine each tag *in the up-scaled image where it's big*, with a window sized to the
tag, and only then map the corner back. (`detect.py` clamps the window to ~¼ the tag's shortest
edge.)

### Subtlety B: map corners back with the pixel-centre convention

`cv2.resize` follows a pixel-*centre* convention: a feature at native coordinate `N` lands at
`(N + 0.5)·s − 0.5` in the up-scaled image. Inverting that naïvely as `c / s` over-shifts every
corner by a constant `0.5·(1 − 1/s)` (0.25 px at 2×, 0.33 px at 3×). A *constant* shift in all
corners doesn't blur the fit — it moves the **principal point**:

| | principal-point error |
|---|---|
| map back with `c / s` | ~0.83 px ❌ |
| map back with `(c + 0.5)/s − 0.5` | ~0.03 px ✅ |

This one cost real debugging time: the focal length and reprojection error looked great, but
`cx, cy` were biased ~0.8 px *in the same direction* — the fingerprint of a constant offset. The
lesson: **a systematic (not random) corner error hides in the principal point, not the RMS.**

## 5. Fix #2 — board-guided recovery (opt-in, for the last mile)

For tags multi-scale still misses, use the board's known geometry: fit a *local* homography from
the nearest detected tags, predict where the missing tag must be, and re-detect inside a small
up-scaled ROI — accepting only tags whose id re-detects (so it adds no false corners). This is
the AprilGrid analogue of ChArUco's `refineDetectedMarkers` and TartanCalib's `cornerpredictor`:

```python
from ds_msp.calib import AprilGridTarget
target = AprilGridTarget(6, 6, 0.088, 0.3)           # TUM-VI board
dets = detect_aprilgrid(paths, scales=(1, 2, 3), target=target, recover=True)
```

On this dataset multi-scale already grabs everything recoverable, so recovery is mostly
redundant here — but it works from sparse seeds (6 detected tags → 25), and it's the right tool
when you can afford fewer scales or the board is partly occluded. Its honest limit: a homography
*extrapolates* poorly to tags right on the image border, which is where the next idea comes in.

## 6. The frontier — detect on a reprojected view

The extreme image-edge tags (curved *and* truncated) defeat both fixes. The production answer
(TartanCalib's first method) is to **reproject the fisheye into a virtual pinhole pointed at the
board**, where the tags become near-frontal with straight edges, detect there, and map the
corners back through the camera model. On frame 316 this recovers 7 more tags (26 → 33). That is
exactly the library's sphere/cylinder/pinhole reprojection machinery applied to the
calibration front-end — the same `project`/`unproject` maps, used to make detection robust.
(Experimental; see `experiments/aprilgrid_virtual_pinhole.py`.)

## 7. The payoff — a tighter calibration, for free

Multi-scale detection (with both subtleties fixed) doesn't just find more tags; it makes the
[capstone](capstone_calibrating_a_real_camera.md) **strictly better on every metric**, because
the recovered tags are the wide-FOV corners that constrain focal length and distortion:

| | corners | median reproj | focal agreement | principal point |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| single-scale | 5 180 | 0.115 px | ~0.7 % | ~0.15 px |
| **multi-scale (default)** | **14 460** | **0.081 px** | **0.003 %** | **~0.03 px** |

Three more wide-angle corners per tag, and the focal agreement with TUM-VI's published
Kannala-Brandt calibration tightens from ~0.7 % to **0.003 %** — essentially exact.

## Try it yourself
1. Re-run the snippet in §1 on `cam1` instead of `cam0`. Same dropout?
2. In the capstone, force single-scale (`detect_aprilgrid(..., scales=(1,))`) and watch the
   corner count *halve* and the focal agreement loosen — the wide-FOV corners earn their place.
3. Set `scales=(1, 2)` and watch recall sit between `(1,)` and `(1, 2, 3)`. More scales = more
   recall, at a (small) time cost.
