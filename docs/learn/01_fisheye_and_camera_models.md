# Chapter 1 — Fisheye lenses & what a "camera model" actually is

> **Run alongside this:** `python examples/01_realdata_fisheye_tumvi.py`
> (after the [setup](README.md#setup-once)). Read this, then read the printed numbers.

## 1. The problem with straight lines

A **pinhole** camera has one defining property: straight lines in the world stay
straight in the image. It's the model behind `cv2.solvePnP`, most SfM, and the matrix
`K` you've seen a hundred times. It works because projection is a clean perspective
division: `u = fx·X/Z + cx`.

A **fisheye** lens deliberately breaks this to buy field of view — often **> 180°**, more
than a hemisphere. Run the example and open `results/learn/01_fisheye_raw.png`: the
ceiling lights bow into arcs. A pinhole model literally *cannot* describe this — and
worse, `X/Z` blows up as a ray approaches 90° off-axis (`Z → 0`), and goes nonsensical
beyond it (`Z < 0`, i.e. light from *behind* the pinhole). You need a different model.

## 2. A camera model is a pair of functions

Strip away the mystique. A camera model is just two maps plus a handful of numbers
(the *intrinsics*):

- **project**: 3D point in the camera frame → 2D pixel. `(X,Y,Z) ↦ (u,v)`
- **unproject**: 2D pixel → 3D unit ray (bearing). `(u,v) ↦ (x,y,z)`, ‖·‖ = 1

That's the entire interface — and in this library it's literally the
[`CameraModel`](../../ds_msp/core/contracts.py) contract every model implements. The
*only* thing that differs between pinhole, Double Sphere, Kannala-Brandt, etc. is the
math inside those two functions. Same interface, swappable internals.

In the example:
```python
cam, (W, H) = load_kalibr_with_resolution(CAMCHAIN, cam="cam0")
rays, ok = cam.unproject(pixels)   # 2D → 3D
back, ok2 = cam.project(rays)      # 3D → 2D
```

## 3. A calibration is just numbers in a file

We don't calibrate anything in this chapter — we *load* a calibration that the TUM-VI
dataset authors already computed and published, straight from their Kalibr YAML:

```
KannalaBrandtModel(fx=190.978, fy=190.973, cx=254.932, cy=256.897,
                   k=[0.00348, 0.00072, -0.00205, 0.00020])
```

Six-plus numbers fully describe this fisheye camera. `fx, fy` are focal lengths in
pixels, `cx, cy` the optical center, and the `k`'s shape the radial distortion. TUM-VI's
file says `pinhole + equidistant`, which is the **Kannala-Brandt** model (the same one
behind OpenCV's `cv2.fisheye`). The library reads it and hands you a working object.
*(Later chapters swap in the Double Sphere model, which handles >180° more gracefully.)*

## 4. The non-negotiable habit: verify, don't trust

Here's the mindset that separates 3D-vision work from "it looked fine on my test image."
project and unproject must be **inverses**: unproject a pixel to a ray, project it back,
and you must land on the original pixel. The example measures exactly this on a grid of
1600 real pixels:

```
project(unproject(x)) round-trip: mean=1.55e-14px  max=9.10e-14px
```

`1e-14` is machine precision for `float64` — the functions are inverse to the last bit
the hardware can represent. If that number were `0.3px` instead, your unprojection has a
bug, full stop. **Always have a number that proves correctness.** It's how you debug, and
(later) it's how you earn a reviewer's trust.

> The `ok` masks matter too: not every pixel is valid (some lie outside the lens's image
> circle), and not every 3D ray is projectable. A correct model tells you *which* —
> Chapter 3 is entirely about that boundary for >180° lenses.

## 5. Undistortion: "what would a pinhole have seen?"

Finally the example rectifies a real frame into a virtual pinhole view and saves
`results/learn/01_fisheye_rectified.png`. Compare it to the raw frame: the bowed ceiling
lines are now straight. Mechanically (see [`ds_msp/ops/undistort.py`](../../ds_msp/ops/undistort.py)),
for every output pixel we build a pinhole ray with a fresh `K_new`, **project it through
the fisheye model** to find where to sample the source image, and resample. The `balance`
knob trades field-of-view for how much black border you tolerate.

This is why undistortion can't keep a full >180° FOV: a pinhole image plane is infinite
at 90°, so the periphery has nowhere to go. Wide-FOV pixels are not lost to a bug — they
are geometrically un-pinhole-able. (More in Chapter 3.)

## Try it yourself
1. Re-run with `balance=1.0` in the script — predict whether the rectified image gets
   *more* or *less* black border before you look.
2. Load `cam="cam1"` (the other stereo camera) and confirm its intrinsics differ slightly.
3. Widen the verification grid toward the image edge (`np.linspace(2, W-2, …)`) and watch
   how many pixels fall *outside* the valid mask.

**Next:** [Chapter 2](02_double_sphere_model.md) opens up the Double Sphere model, derives
its projection from a two-sphere geometric picture, and uses it to reproduce TUM-VI's
published calibration to a fortieth of a pixel.
