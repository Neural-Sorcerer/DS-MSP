"""Neutral geometry primitives — the shared single-/multi-view geometry layer.

One resection/PnP, robust pose averaging, and covisibility-graph utilities, consumed by
both single-camera (``calib``) and multi-camera (``rig``) calibration so neither has to
import the other. Pure NumPy + stdlib; depends only on ``core`` (and ``data``) — never on
``models``, detection, IO, or a service layer, and never on OpenCV.
