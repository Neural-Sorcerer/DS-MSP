"""Detection adapters (ChArUco / AprilGrid).

The OpenCV-facing layer: turn images into 3D<->2D correspondences as :mod:`ds_msp.data`
records. This is the only place under the calibration stack (besides ``io``) where cv2 is
allowed — the geometry/solver path stays NumPy-native. Depends on ``data`` + ``core``.
