Camera model conversion ("adapter").

Converts an already-calibrated source model to a target model **without images or
recalibration**: sample pixels -> unproject with the source -> seed the target ->
refine with Levenberg-Marquardt using each model's **analytic** param Jacobian
(no autodiff). Mirrors the fisheye-calib-adapter pipeline in pure Python.

Global optimum, any scenario
----------------------------
A single linear seed plus one local refine can stall in a poor basin when the
target's shape parameters are far from their seed (e.g. a strong-``xi`` Double
Sphere, an EUCM+ whose ``beta`` is far from the linear seed's ``beta=1``, or a
polynomial OCam whose higher coefficients matter). To find the *global* optimum
regardless of the source, the refine runs as a **multi-start**: the linear seed,
a **deterministic sweep** that walks each finitely-bounded shape parameter across
its range, and ``n_restarts`` additional random dispersed seeds — keeping the
lowest-cost fit. The deterministic sweep makes the result reproducible and removes
the random-restart lottery that previously let some targets (notably EUCM+) settle
in a wrong basin and fail even to self-convert. Only the *shape* parameters are
seeded; the intrinsics (fx, fy, cx, cy) start from their closed-form linear seed.

Decoupled by dependency injection: ``convert`` takes the source instance and the
target *class*, so this module imports no concrete model — only the contract and
SciPy. Works with any model satisfying ``CameraModel``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    source : CameraModel
        The calibrated source model.
    target_cls : type[CameraModel]
        The model class to convert into.
    width, height : int
        Image size used for sampling and reporting.
    n_samples : int
        Approximate number of grid samples used for the fit.
    max_fov_deg : float, optional
        Restrict the fitted FOV (full angle). Useful when the target is narrower
        than the source (e.g. converting a >180 deg fisheye into a pinhole-like
        model) so the fit is not dragged by unrepresentable rays.
    n_restarts : int
        Number of *random* dispersed shape-parameter restarts, in addition to the
        linear seed and the always-on deterministic shape sweep. ``0`` keeps just
        the linear seed plus the deterministic sweep (already multi-start and
        reproducible); higher values add random joint-perturbation restarts.
    seed : int
        RNG seed for the restart dispersion, so conversions are reproducible.

    Returns
    -------
    (target, report) : the fitted model and a quality report (see
    ``reprojection_report``). ``report["n_restarts"]`` records the restart count.
