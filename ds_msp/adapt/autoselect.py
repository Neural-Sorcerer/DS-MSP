"""
Automatic target-model selection for conversion.

``convert`` finds the best parameters for a *given* target model. But a target
model can be unable to represent a lens *at any parameters* — a representability
limit, not an optimiser failure. The deciding quantity is the number of
independent **shape** degrees of freedom each model exposes in its radial profile
r(theta). Expand the normalised profile as ``r/r'(0) = theta + c3 theta^3 +
c5 theta^5 + ...``; the map (shape params) -> (c3, c5, c7, ...) has image
dimension equal to the shape-parameter count: UCM 1, Double Sphere 2, EUCM 2,
OCam 4, Kannala-Brandt 4. A Kannala-Brandt source fixes four independent
coefficients (k1..k4); a model with fewer shape dof generically cannot reach that
point, so its *global* optimum carries a strictly positive residual (tens of
pixels for a strongly-distorted lens). This is geometry of the model family, not
conditioning or local minima — DS still ties KB sub-pixel on ordinary fisheyes,
whose c5/c7 happen to be consistent with their c3 (i.e. they lie on the DS image).

``convert_best`` makes "find an optimal solution in any scenario" concrete: it
tries a capability-ordered ladder of target models and returns the **simplest one
that meets a reprojection-RMS tolerance** (Occam's razor — prefer the fewest
parameters that suffice). If none meet the tolerance it returns the best
available and says so. The default ladder ends in OCam (a polynomial radial map),
which can reproduce any Kannala-Brandt lens — itself a radial polynomial — to
well under a pixel.

This module is allowed to depend on concrete models (it provides a default
ladder); ``convert`` itself stays model-free.

    Parameters
    ----------
    source : CameraModel
        The calibrated source model to convert.
    width, height : int
        Image size for sampling and reporting.
    candidates : sequence of model classes, optional
        Capability-ordered ladder to try. Defaults to :func:`default_ladder`.
    target_rms : float
        Reprojection-RMS tolerance in pixels. The first candidate at or under
