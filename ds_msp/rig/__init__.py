"""Multi-camera rig calibration — the N-camera analogue of MC-Calib.

DS-MSP's single-camera, multi-model intrinsics (``calib.bundle``) and two-view MVG
(``mvg``) are extended here to a full rig: many cameras + many planar boards observed
over many frames, fused into one consistent set of extrinsics + intrinsics.

The math is **model-agnostic** — every routine composes poses and calls a
``CameraModel``'s ``project`` / ``unproject`` / ``project_jacobian``. So the entire
pipeline works for any of DS-MSP's camera models, exactly as it is in MC-Calib.
